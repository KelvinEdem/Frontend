// Math Operator Shorthand Methods. This operation was carries out in the console aspect of chrome
/*var myVar = 10
undefined
This provides the output 15
myVar = myVar + 5
15
A simple way of doing this is below
myVar += 5
20
myVar += 1
21
The below ++ means plus one. If the operation comes after the number, the result would be the same as the previous number,
not until you call the variable again.
myVar++
21

myVar
22
myVar ++
22
myVar
23
To avoid calling the variable again in order to provide the right output, the ++ should be appear before the variable 
++myVar
