//comparison operators (less than, greater than, equal to (==), negation sign(!) less than or equal to and greater than or equal to)
/*the single equal to is used to assign a value to a variable whiles the double is used to compare values
the triple equal to is used to check the value and type. The type in the sense that is it the same as the string value?
the negation sign is used to prove that  a number is not equal to its value. for instance;
x !==5 whiles the actual value of x = "5" which is a string, would return true.  
x = "5"
5
x !== 5
true*/
