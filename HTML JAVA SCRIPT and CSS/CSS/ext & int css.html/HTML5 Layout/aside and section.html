    <!-- The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.
When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the 
article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to 
the article it relates to. When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container 
for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list 
of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author. -->

<!-- The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
For example, on a homepage there may be several <section> elements to contain different sections of the page, such as 
latest news, top products, and newsletter signup.
Because the <section> element groups related items together, it may contain several distinct <article> elements that have 
a common theme or purpose. Alternatively, if you have a page with a long article, the <section> element can be 
used to split the article up into separate sections. The <section> element should not be used as a wrapper for 
the entire page (unless the page only contains one distinct piece of content). If you want a containing element for the 
entire page, that job is still best left to the <div> element -->
