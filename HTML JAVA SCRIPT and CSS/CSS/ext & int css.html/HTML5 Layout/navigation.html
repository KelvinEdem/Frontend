    <!-- The <nav> element is used to 
        contain the major navigational 
        blocks on the site such as the 
        primary site navigation.
        Going back to our blog example, 
        if you wanted to finish an article 
        with links to related blog posts, 
        these would not be counted as 
        major navigational blocks and 
        therefore should not sit inside a 
        <nav> element.
        At the time of writing, some of 
        the developers that were already 
        using HTML5 decided to use the 
        <nav> element for the links that 
        appear at the bottom of every 
        page (links to things like privacy 
        policy, terms and conditions 
        and accessibility information). 
        Whether this will be widely 
        adopted is still yet to be seen. -->
