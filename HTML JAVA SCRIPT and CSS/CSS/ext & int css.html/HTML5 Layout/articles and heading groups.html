    <!-- The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.
If a page contains several articles (or even summaries of several articles), then each individual article would live inside its own 
<article> element.
The <article> elements can even be nested inside each other. For example, a blog post might live inside one <article>
element and each comment on the article could live inside its own child <article> element. -->

    <!-- The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are 
treated as one single heading. For example, the <hgroup>element could be used to contain both a title inside an <h2>
element and a subtitle within an <h3> element.
    This element has had a mixed reception. When it was first proposed by the people developing HTML5, there were 
some complaints and it was withdrawn from the HTML5 proposals. However, some people changed their minds and 
it has been added it back into the language. Some developers do not like the use of the <hgroup>element, and prefer to place a 
subtitle inside a <p> element (using an attribute to indicate that it is a subheading).
    Some suggest that it is of little use other than as a styling hook. It has, however, been popular with those developers who 
believe that it is useful to group together the primary heading and the subheading (as both can be integral parts of a heading). -->
