        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>&copy; or &#169;Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between thr copies of <i>Nature, New Scientitist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite><i>On The Road.</i></cite> It had been Mollys favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wide wide quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the Liama <acronym title="Deoxyribonucleric acid">DNA</acronym>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did </em> think she had something better to do.</p>
